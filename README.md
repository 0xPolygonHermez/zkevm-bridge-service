# zkEVM Bridge service

This repo implements a backend service written in Go, that enables clients, like the [web UI](https://github.com/0xPolygonHermez/zkevm-bridge-ui),
to interact with the [bridge smart contract](https://github.com/0xPolygonHermez/zkevm-contracts) by providing Merkleproofs.

The software is currently not ready to be used, and more instructions for running and developing it will be provided in the very near future.

## Running the bridge service
